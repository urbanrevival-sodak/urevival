	<h1>OUR MISSION</h1>
	
	<p class="mission">In the urban history scope of the Pine Ridge Reservation and Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, this study seeks to illuminate the historical visual of treaty violations and territorial loss. The analysis focuses on the interplay of land dispossession and the development of the built environment. By investigating past conditions, analyzing present challenges, and forecasting the future trajectory, this study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the enduring impact of the treaty infringements and urban decay of the two indigenous communities from 1868 until today.</p>
	<p class="mission"> The research starts with the treaties that designated land to the indigenous communities. Through the violation of these treaties, an examination of the resultant social injustices and their impact on the built environment. That impact is still witnessed today, as the built infrastructure has deteriorated with a lack to resources to support. Pine Ridge and Rosebud rank among the top five most impoverished counties in the United States. “The 10 most disadvantaged communities—which are home to more than 120,000 people—are all rural. The four counties in South Dakota are home to Sovereign Tribal Nations” - Michigan News, University of Michigan, 2020.</p>
	<p class="mission"> The study will analyze current conditions through the scope of community members, images, video, and a series of interviews done through visual documentation with an overlay of discussion-scholarly based podcast material. The emphasis on community feedback will provide a substantial amount of valuable information for the research. The podcast will consist of interviewees discussing the research. The timeline visualization will consist of chronological history supported with graphical representations throughout the visuals.</p>
	<p class="mission"> By tracing the trajectory from past conditions to present challenges and envisioning a more hopeful future, this research has revealed the enduring impact of these treaty infringements and the urban decay that has plagued these communities for over a century. However, our study does not stop at mere documentation of the challenges. Instead, it strives to create a vision for the future. By engaging with the communities, themselves and proposing sustainable urban development strategies, we aim to improve the social and built environments. We firmly believe that the key to progress lies in community engagement, as their insights and voices will guide us in finding effective solutions to the problems identified. By collectively envisioning and working toward a brighter, more sustainable future, we can begin to rectify the injustices of the past and pave the way for urban revival in the Pine Ridge and Rosebud Reservations.</p>
